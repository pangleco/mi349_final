            <h2>MSU Teacher Ranker</h2>

            <p>
                Learned the BeautifulSoup library for Python to scrape data from the popular websites "MSUGrades.com" and "RateMyProfessor.com"
                to help students find the best professor for their desired course. The program asks a user for a valid MSU course number and then proceeds to plug this information into
                MSUGrades to then pull up each professors average and median grade reports, next it uses each professor to then look up their individual professor ratings on RateMyProfessor.
                These values are then converted into like fractions and weighted to give each professor for the class a score which helps the user decide on who they should pick for their next class.

            <h2>Text Summarizer</h2>

            <p>
                Worked in a group project consisting of 3 other students in my machine learning course
                to build a text summarizer using BERT. Throughout this project we learned about many
                different summarization methods as well as how to test these summaries (in the end
                using Rouge for scoring). Along with the program itself we also wrote and presented a paper
                on our subject to the class to teach them about our findings.
